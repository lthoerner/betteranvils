# The absolute maximum level cost for all anvil operations
max-cost: 30

# The multiplier of cost per enchantment level
# For example, if enchant-cost-multiplier is 2, then adding a Fortune V book to a pickaxe will cost 10 levels

# The flat cost of renaming an item
rename-cost: 1

# The amount of durability that is repaired per level cost
# For example, if durability-per-level is 100, then a pickaxe with 700/1000 durability will cost 3 levels to repair
durability-per-level: 100

# The minimum cost to repair an item, regardless of durability
# Higher values tend to punish repairs of cheap items such as stone tools
min-repair-cost: 3

# The amount of materials required to repair an item, based on how many items it took to craft the item
# For example, if repair-materials-per-item is 1, then a diamond chestplate will require 8 diamonds to repair fully,
# whereas if repair-materials-per-item is 0.5, then a diamond chestplate will require 4 diamonds to repair fully
# This should be below 1 if you want a repair to be more cost-effective than crafting a new item

# Whether to use the vanilla max level configuration
# If this is set to true, then the max level configuration below will be ignored

# The maximum level allowed for each enchantment
# NOTE: Enchantments with a max level of 1 do not do anything different at higher levels,
# and some enchantments behave strangely at higher levels (quick charge, frost walker, etc.)
# Mess with these at your own risk
