# BetterAnvils

## Overview
BetterAnvils is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that reimplements the functionality of the vanilla anvil,
allowing for greater configuration of the anvil's behavior by server owners and a much more pleasant
experience for players.

## Features
- Configurable maximum enchant levels for each enchantment (i.e. Fortune V, Sharpness X, etc.)
- Configurable cost multipliers for enchanting and repairing
- Configurable maximum enchant/repair level cost (no more *"Too Expensive!"*)
- Configurable material repair cost
- Smarter enchant/repair/rename behavior to prevent players from accidentally spending materials, tools,
or levels on useless operations

## Installation
Download **BetterAnvils.jar** from the `releases/` directory and place it in your server's `plugins/` directory.
Once the plugin is installed, you can configure it by editing the `config.yml` file in the `plugins/BetterAnvils/`
directory.
